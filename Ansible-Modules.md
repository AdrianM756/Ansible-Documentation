## Ansible Module

[Ansible module](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/automation/what-is-an-ansible-module) is a small program that performs actions on a local machine, application programming interface (API), or remote host.

Modules are expressed as code, usually in Python, and contain metadata that defines when and where a specific automation task is executed and which users can execute it.
